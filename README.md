In this program, a tired parent is attempting to gather all of the necessary items to lure their baby to bed and put them to sleep for the night. If the parent encounters the baby before all of the bedtime items are gathered, the baby will not go to sleep. If the parent manages to gather all of the bedtime items before encountering the baby, the baby will go to sleep.
